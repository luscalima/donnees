# Issue Guidelines

The issues area is reserved for bug reports and feature requests. That means we do not accept usage questions (docs will be created for each new functionality implemented on the platform). If you open an issue that does not conform to the requirements, it will be closed immediately.

Also try to search for your issue - it may have already been answered or even fixed in the development branch. However, if you don't find what you're looking for, follow the structure below to write a new issue that better suits your nature.

## Feature Request

### **Issue title (feature)**

This will be a person's first contact with the issue, so be as objective and clear as possible.

### **What problem does this feature solve?**

Explain your use case, context, and rationale behind this feature request. What is the end user experience you are trying to build that led to the need for this feature? An important design goal of **donnees** is keeping the UI straightforward. It is preferable to only consider adding new features that solve a problem that cannot be solved with existing features. The problem should also be common enough to justify the addition.

### **What does the proposed UI look like?**

Describe how you propose to solve the problem and provide UI samples of how the feature would work once implemented. Add some type of sketch, print or diagram that serves to illustrate the feature and its operation.

## Bug Report

### **Issue title (bug)**

This will be a person's first contact with the issue, so be as objective and clear as possible.

### **What is expected?**

Describe what should happen that isn't happening.

### **What is actually happening?**

Describe the unexpected behavior that is happening.

### **Steps to reproduce**

What do we need to do after opening your repro in order to make the bug happen? Clear and concise reproduction instructions are important for us to be able to triage your issue in a timely manner. Use Markdown to format lists.

### **Any additional comments? (optional)**

e.g. some background/context of how you ran into this bug.
