# Code of Conduct

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone. There is no exemptions for the behavior we outline as unacceptable in this Code of Conduct.

To create a positive environment, use welcoming language, respect different points of view, accept constructive criticism, focus on the good of the community and project, and show empathy.

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported and the complaints will be reviewed and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.
